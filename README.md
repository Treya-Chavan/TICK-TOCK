# TICK-TOCK
You and your crew are stuck in a room. You just have one attempt to unlock and escape. If you fail you are locked forever. The key to the door will unlock only when the CLOCK shows 12:00:00.  Unfortunately, there is no clock in the room which can show you the time. However, you have a computer!
